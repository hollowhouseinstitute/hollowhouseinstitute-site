## Structured Human Intelligence

**Time turns behavior into infrastructure.**  
**Behavior is the most honest data there is.**

This repository is the official GitHub home for the **Hollow House Institute** public profile, identity, and professional documentation.

Hollow House Institute is a **behavioral AI governance and compliance organization** specializing in longitudinal analysis of human and AI systems over time. We focus on detecting and quantifying systemic drift, decision substitution, escalation decay, and risk accumulation that emerge through repeated system use.

## Proprietary Metrics

Hollow House Institute uses rigorously defined, proprietary metrics:

- **Loyalty Load Index (LLI)** — measures harm absorbed to remain connected  
- **Repair Integrity Score (RIS)** — distinguishes real change from cyclical repair  
- **Identity Harm Severity (IHS)** — flags non-mitigable identity-level harm  
- **Exit Cost Ratio (ECR)** — compares cost of leaving versus staying

Each metric is formally defined in the Institute’s governance documentation.
