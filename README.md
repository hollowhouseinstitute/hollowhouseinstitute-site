# Hollow House Institute — Website Source

This repository contains the **source for the Hollow House Institute public website**.

The site is a static content project built with Jekyll and deployed via GitHub Pages / Vercel for public presentation of governance frameworks, publications, and institutional identity.

## Development & Deployment

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hollowhouseinstitute/Hollow_House_Institute-site.git- human judgment
- escalation behavior
- accountability assignment
- organizational decision-making

Our work addresses risks that do not appear in point-in-time reviews, static benchmarks, or model evaluations.

---

## Core Focus Areas

- Behavioral drift over time  
- Decision substitution and confidence reinforcement  
- Escalation decay and override erosion  
- Normalization of workarounds  
- Accumulated identity and governance harm  

Behavior is treated as **auditable infrastructure**, not anecdotal signal.

---

## Governance Framework

### Longitudinal Relational Governance Framework™

A proprietary audit and governance framework that converts repeated human–AI interaction into **measurable, reviewable governance risk**.

**Foundational Doctrine**
- Time turns behavior into infrastructure  
- Behavior is the most honest data there is  

---

## Proprietary Metrics

Hollow House Institute uses defined, non-public metrics, including:

- **Loyalty Load Index (LLI)**  
- **Repair Integrity Score (RIS)**  
- **Identity Harm Severity (IHS)**  
- **Exit Cost Ratio (ECR)**  

Metric definitions and usage are governed under the Master License Suite.
