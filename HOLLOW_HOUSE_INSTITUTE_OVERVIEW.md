# Hollow House Institute — Public Overview

**Structured Human Intelligence**  
*Time turns behavior into infrastructure.*

---

## Who We Are

Hollow House Institute is an independent governance and audit organization focused on **longitudinal behavioral risk in AI systems**.

We analyze how repeated AI use reshapes human judgment, accountability, and escalation behavior over time—risks that emerge gradually and are often invisible to conventional audits.

---

## What We Do

We provide:
- Longitudinal AI governance audits  
- Behavioral risk analysis across deployment lifecycles  
- Oversight of decision substitution and escalation decay  
- Evaluation of normalization and workaround drift  

Our work treats behavior as **infrastructure**, not anecdote.

---

## Why This Matters

Most AI failures do not occur at deployment.  
They occur after repeated successful use—when trust accumulates, judgment shifts, and override capacity erodes.

If behavioral drift is not measured, governance silently degrades.

---

## Governance Approach

Our methodology is grounded in a proprietary framework that converts repeated human–AI interaction into **auditable governance signals**.

We maintain strict controls over:
- data access
- derivative use
- AI training
- commercialization

---

## Licensing & Protection

All Hollow House Institute materials are governed under a private licensing and governance regime.

- No open use  
- No AI training  
- No commercial exploitation  
- Access by written authorization only  

Authoritative licensing instruments are publicly available for review.
