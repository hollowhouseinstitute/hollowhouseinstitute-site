<h1>Hollow House Institute</h1>
<h2>Structured Human Intelligence</h2>

<p><strong>Time turns behavior into infrastructure.</strong><br>
<strong>Behavior is the most honest data there is.</strong></p>

<p>
Independent AI governance and compliance audits for enterprise systems,
platforms, and organizations.
</p>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>
We measure how risk, harm, and instability accumulate over time through repeated behavioral patterns—
not snapshot audits, sentiment analysis, or static datasets.
</p>

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>
Most AI failures do not occur when controls are bypassed.
They occur when controls are passed repeatedly while behavior quietly shifts.
